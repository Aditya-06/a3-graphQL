# Assignment 3 - Java

Welcome to Assignment 2! This is the Java setup repository for Assignment 2. You can find the assignment PDF on Canvas.

## Installation

To get started, you will need to have Java and Gradle installed on your machine. If you don't have them installed, you can download them from the official website: [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html) and [Gradle](https://gradle.org/install/)

## Assignment

Currently, this is just starter code with a basic test case. 
Your task is to implement a [GQL server in Java](https://www.graphql-java.com/). You will need to implement the queries and mutations specified in the assignment PDF. You do not need to write any tests this time around, but we do need manual testing screenshots in the design document.


To test - 
```
gradle test
```

Good luck and have fun!
