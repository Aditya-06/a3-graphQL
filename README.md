## Assignment 3 - GraphQL API
Welcome to Assignment 2! In this assignment, you will be designing and implementing a GraphQL API for a medical practice management software company. You will be given a set of requirements and a set of tests that your API must pass. You will be graded on the design of your API, the correctness of your implementation, and the quality of your tests.

## Background
Doctor’s Assistant Inc (DAI) is a software company that has a platform that supports small medical practices by providing tools to build an online presence, help recruit new patients, and manage pre and post visit interactions with patients.

Both DAI, and DAI’s customers have been experiencing significant growth in recent years. Some of DAI’s customers have begun supporting “medical tourism”, where people will travel abroad for medical care (typically due to the availability and cost of care). Additionally, DAI has begun to license their software to partners in developing regions. These partners will tailor DAI’s platform and sell the services to their local market.

This growth has changed some of the needs of the current end users of the software as well as expanded the set of developers that will be using the API. In addition to in-house developers, the API will be used by developers from the licensed partners to support their localized needs.

## Submission
We highly recommend you do this assignment in Typescipt. You could use Java or Python, but your lovely TAs would not be able to support you. For more information on how to set up your development environment for each language, please refer to the **README.md** files in the respective directories.

Once you have designed, developed and manually tested the API in your chosen language, submit a pdf document with the following:
1. Three sections namely Design, Testing and Reflection. 
2. In the Design section, document the deliverables shown in 1.1 Design subtask and 1.2 Testcases design subtask. 
3. In the Testing section, co-relate each test executed clearly to the testcase as shown in the document referred to the testcases documented in point b.
4. The Reflection section should be documented so that we can clearly see the answers to the questions.



## Grading
| Criteria                                                             | Points |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| Design subtask                                                       | 30     |
| Testcases design subtask                                             | 10     |
| Tests specify both correct and incorrect API calls                   | 10     |
| Tests adequately cover specified testcases described in the document | 10     |
| Coding Schema, Queries, Mutations and Resolvers                      | 20     |
| Reflection                                                           | 20     |

Good luck and have fun!
