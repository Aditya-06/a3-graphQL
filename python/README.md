# Assignment 3 - Python

Welcome to Assignment 1! This is the Python setup repository for Assignment 1. You can find the assignment PDF on Canvas.

## Installation & Setup

To get started, you will need to have Python 3.12.0 installed on your machine. If you don't have them installed, you can download them from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

After this, you can create a virtual environment using venv 

```powershell
<venv>\Scripts\Activate.ps1 # for Windows PowerShell
```
or
```bash
source <venv>/bin/activate # for unix based systems 
```
Refer to https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html for more information.

## Assignment

**HERE LIE DRAGONS**. Turn back to Typescript or Java if you want to live. JK, you can stay if you want to suffer.

Currently, this is just starter code with a basic test case.

You will need to implement the queries and mutations specified in the assignment PDF. You do not need to write any tests this time around, but we do need manual testing screenshots in the design document.

Good luck and have fun!
